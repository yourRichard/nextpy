## 🤩 Nextpy : Build apps that write themselves 

Build apps —effortlessly and quickly ⚡. It simplifies Pythonic development for everything from backends to frontends (yes, visually 🦚stunning frontends in Python!), AI integrations, APIs, and beyond—empowering both humans and AI agents.

Nextpy is designed to solve compatibility issues and improve code generation. It is built on our insight🔍 that the choice of underlying frameworks significantly affects the efficiency of AI code generation, regardless of other factors such as LLMs, prompts, or fine-tuning methods.

- ⏰ **What You Can Build in 1 hour:** Beautiful portfolios, dashboards, portals, data apps, internal tools, APIs etc.

- 📚 ***& The best part? Transferable Knowledge:*** Building with nextpy `progressively` teaches you framework-agnostic fundamentals and the best python libraries- FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLModel, Pandas, Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, etc.

- ⚡ **4-10x faster than Streamlit:** Our compiled app achieves a staggering 4-10x performance leap over Streamlit. See the difference for yourself at [nextpy.org](https://nextpy.org), boasting a PageSpeed score of 99/100

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 mins)

[![Build a python webapp in 3 minutes](https://github.com/anubrag/nextpy/assets/25473195/c41ea5b7-d270-451a-a0d0-8308ff9dbfdc)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ex-c9wwiYE)


**1. Installing Nextpy**

Open your terminal and prepare for an adventure of a lifetime!

```bash
pip install nextpy
```

**(Remember, Python 3.7 or later is required.)**

**2. Initializing Your App**

Navigate to the desired directory for your project in the terminal. Use the `nextpy init` command to initialize a template app in your new directory.

```bash
nextpy init
```

**3. Choose your template:**

For now, just press enter to automatically default to the blank template.
```md
    Blank Template: A simple single page template
    Base Template: A multi-page app with a sidebar
```

**4. Running the App**

In the same directory where you previously ran nextpy init, enter the following command:

```bash
nextpy run
```

**5. View the App:**

Check out your app by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> [!NOTE]
> Your application is now fully functional. To view the frontend, navigate to `localhost:3000`. The backend server is accessible at `localhost:8000`.
> While it's unlikely you'll ever directly interact with it, the backend API documentation can be found at `localhost:8000/docs`, and the openapi.json file is located at `localhost:8000/openapi.json`.


## 🎨 Start with a template!

We speedup your development with a [ever growing list of community templates](https://github.com/dot-agent/nextpy/tree/main/app-examples). Some examples:

<table border="0">

### Setting Up the Template
1. Copy the template files to your local folder.
2. Install necessary dependencies with **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**.
3. Initialize your app by running **`nextpy init`**.
4. Launch the app with **`nextpy run`** to see it in action. To check the site visit `localhost:3000`

### 🤣 Building a Joke Generator App (5 mins)

Edit `myapp/myapp.py` to create your app.

#### 1. Import Libraries

```python
import nextpy as xt
import pyjokes
```

Start by importing `nextpy` for development and `pyjokes` for random jokes.

#### 2. Set Up the App State

```python
class State(xt.State):
    joke: str = "Click the button to get a joke!"

    def generate_joke(self):
        self.joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
```

Create a `State` class with a `joke` variable. Use `generate_joke` to fetch new jokes.

#### 3. Design the Main Page

```python
def index():
    layout = xt.vstack(
        xt.text(State.joke, font_size="2em"),
        xt.button("Generate Joke", on_click=State.generate_joke),
    )
    return layout
```

The `index` function arranges a joke display and a button. `vstack` is used to stack components vertically, while `hstack` is used to stack components horizontally.

#### 4. Optional Styling
```md
def index():
    layout = xt.vstack(
        xt.text(State.joke, font_size="2em"),
        xt.button("Generate Joke", on_click=State.generate_joke),

        spacing="1em",
        align_items="center",
        justify_content="center",
        height="100vh",
   )
    return layout
```
The `spacing` attribute adds space between the `text` and `button` elements, while `align_items` and `justify_content` ensure that these elements are centered. The stack's `height` is set to 100% of the Viewport Height (`100vh`), which allows the vertical stack to fill the entire height of your screen.

#### 5. Setup the app

```python
app = xt.App()
app.add_page(index)

```

Set up the app, add the main page. To view the frontend, navigate to `localhost:3000`.

## Why another framework?
In our quest to create apps that write themselves, we delved deep into a labyrinth of coding tools, frameworks, and libraries. Our experiments spanned all major large language models (LLMs), thousands of prompts, and every major web development framework, from React to Streamlit.

Insight
> [!TIP]
> We found that the choice of the foundational app framework significantly influences code generation efficiency, irrespective of the LLMs, prompts, or fine-tuning methods.

Initially, reflex's flexibility seemed promising, aligning with several of our requirements. However, as we experimented with different web apps, crucial feature gaps emerged. Bridging these gaps necessitated extensive "glue code," which dramatically slowed down development.

For months, we resisted the urge to reinvent the wheel and tried to assemble different tools to bring our vision to life. Instead of creating a framework from scratch, we aimed to create an opinionated app starter kit by selectively incorporating the best features from top frameworks. Although we still view this project as a **full stack app starter kit** rather than a framework, the distinction is becoming somewhat blurred as we have developed several custom modules and made specific design decisions.

This framework combines Streamlit's simplicity with Next.js's speed and flexibility. For the backend, FastAPI's ease of use is enhanced by Pydantic's strong type-checking. The frontend utilizes Reflex, Reacton, and Solara libraries, enabling not just web app support but also GUI integration within Jupyter, adding new components seamlessly. We're currently refining our Python-to-JavaScript compiler for improved speed. SQLModel and SQLAlchemy have been integrated for database management. Additionally, we've tailored features for generative AI and introduced a JSON-based database, offering SQL-like functionalities with JSON as the storage format.

**Our mission?** Make Next.py the most efficient app framework, for building self writing applications!
